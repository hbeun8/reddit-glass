This app is called Reddit Glass.
It is the Reddit Client using Reddit API. 

It uses frameworks such as React CSS HTML API and so.

Further, the UI makes use of CSS transitions and animations

Some of the features it has is
1. Searching Subreddits
2. Filtering reddit posts
3. Endless/bottomless scroll
4. React Components, including useState and useEffect.
5. Native CSS.
6. HTML Tags such as Video, Image, Buttons and Drop Downs
7. Responsive Design.

Finally, the client uses unit testing and end to end tests, using Jest and Mock.

In the very near future, i will add Redux and React Routers.
