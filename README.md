This app is called Reddit Glass.
It uses frameworks such as

Further, the UI makes use of CSS transitions and animations

Some of the features it has is

1. Search
2. Filtering reddit posts
3. Endless scroll
4. React Components, including useState and useEffect.
5. Native CSS.
6. HTML Tags such as Video, Image, Buttons and Drop Downs

Finally, the client uses unit testing and end to end tests, using Jest and Mock.
